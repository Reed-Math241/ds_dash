# Lime Scooter Trends

## A `shinydashboard` that explores spatial trends of Lime Scooters across San Francisco

This dashboard is updated every hour and this functionality is made possible by using github actions to run a script on an automated schedule in another repository. That repository is public and can be found [here](https://github.com/joshyam-k/schPull). 

The dashboard is being hosted on my `shiny` account and can be accessed through [this link](https://joshyam.shinyapps.io/shiny_app/)
